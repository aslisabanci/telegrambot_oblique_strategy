# But what is "oblique strategies"?
As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies):
>>> Oblique Strategies (subtitled *Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas*) is a card-based method for promoting creativity jointly created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975. Physically, it takes the form of a deck of 7-by-9-centimetre (2.8 in Ã— 3.5 in) printed cards in a black box. Each card offers a challenging constraint intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative blocks by encouraging lateral thinking.
